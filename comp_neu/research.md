#### [Gaze Dependence of visual working memory representations]()
###### Advisor: Dr. Sridharan Devarajan, Center for Neuroscience, IISc, Banglore. 

We are studying the neural mechanisms of interaction between eye movements & visual working memory representations in the brain
by applying multivariate pattern decoding and spectral analysis to Electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded while humans participants
perform a working memory based psychophysics task involving saccadic eyeshifts during the memory retention period.
Using the inferences drawn from the above experiments and analysis, we will employ non-invasive brain stimulation technique called
transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to perturb or entrain VWM related activity to understand the causal mechanisms behind the 
interaction between visual working memory and eye movements.
